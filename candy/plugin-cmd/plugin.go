// Package cmd is the COMPILED-IN charly COMMAND-class plugin owning the externalized `charly cmd`
// command (#118 loader+check-tail cone) — run a single command in a running container with an
// optional desktop notification.
//
// cmd is COMPILED-IN (charly.yml compiled_plugins): its Invoke(OpRun) runs in charly's process and
// gets the in-proc reverse channel (dispatchInProcCommand threads it), so it drives the
// "pod-lifecycle" host-builder's op="cmd" (the deploy-lifecycle-coupled interactive exec a plugin
// cannot perform — dispatchLifecycleTarget + LifecycleTarget.Attach, cmd's slot in the floored
// pod-lifecycle-dispatch family, #55 W3 A10b) with host-held exec.RunInteractive stdio, and sends
// the completion notification itself.
// The out-of-process CliMain path has no reverse channel and so errors. The SAME NewProvider()/
// NewMeta() compile INTO charly in-process — placement is invisible. It imports ONLY the sdk module,
// never charly core.
